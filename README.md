# 100 Days of CSS Challenge

## Introduction
This project is directly inspired by the [100 Days of CSS Challenge](https://100dayscss.com/) . I'm not sure what to expect in the future, as each new challenge is posted every morning, but I'm excited nonetheless!

## Challenges
1. Social Media Profile
   - Create a social media profile (ex. Twitter, Instagram) with a picture, name, and boxes for posts, likes, and followers.
2. Notifications
   - A list of notifications similar to Facebook, listed in reverse chronological order. A hamburger menu in the top-left corner should display a menu with links to a Dashboard, Profile, Notifications, Messages, and Settings.
3.
