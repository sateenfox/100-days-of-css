# 100 Days of CSS Challenge

## Introduction
This project is directly inspired by the [100 Days of CSS Challenge](https://100dayscss.com/) . I will be recreating the code snippets for each day, but with my own twist on each one as I see fit.

## Challenges
1. Title
   - 100 Days of CSS.
2. Menu Icon
   - Hamburger menu icon that transitions into an X when clicked, and back to a hamburger menu when clicked again.

   - The Giza Pyramids (or another pyramid) in a circle with the sun rising and setting around it.
4. Loading
   - Three stacked, "growing" circles that transition in and out.

   - A social media profile (ex. Twitter, Instagram) with a picture, name, and boxes for posts, likes, and followers.
7. Notifications, Search, and Menu

A hamburger menu in the top-left corner should display a menu with links to a Dashboard, Profile, Notifications, Messages, and Settings when clicked.
